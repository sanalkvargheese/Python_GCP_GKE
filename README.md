Assignment: Building and Versioning a Web Application Using Docker, Kubernetes, and GitHub
Objective:
Develop a web application based on the provided architecture, deploy it using Docker and Kubernetes, and manage your code versioning using GitHub.
Requirements:
- Frontend using HTML and JavaScript
- Backend Python application
- Database connectivity
- Docker containers for each component
- Deployment on a Kubernetes cluster
- Version control using GitHub

Tasks:
1. Setup Version Control:
- Initialize a new repository on GitHub.
- Create a README.md to describe the project.
- Commit an initial empty project structure with directories for the frontend, backend, and deployment configurations.

2. Develop the Frontend:
- Create a basic HTML page with forms to capture two values.
- Use JavaScript to handle form submission and data validation.
- Commit these changes to your GitHub repository.
- Exercise: Enhance the frontend with CSS for styling and make the form responsive. Commit these enhancements.

3. Develop the Python Backend Application:
- Write a Python script that processes data received from the frontend.
- Connect to a database to insert data.
- Commit the backend application to your GitHub repository.
- Exercise: Add error handling and logging. Commit these improvements.

4. Containerization:
- Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and backend.
- Build Docker images and test them locally.
- Commit the Dockerfiles and any related configurations to the GitHub repository.
- Exercise: Optimize Dockerfile to reduce image size and commit the changes.

5. Kubernetes Deployment:
- Write Kubernetes YAML configurations for both services.
- Deploy to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
- Configure a Load Balancer to manage traffic.
- Commit all Kubernetes configuration files to your GitHub repository.
- Exercise: Set up basic monitoring and logging for Kubernetes deployments and commit the configurations.

6. Version Control Practices:
- Use GitHub for all code and configuration files.
- Practice branching for new features and bug fixes.
- Use pull requests to merge changes from branches to the main branch after review.
- Exercise: Regularly commit with meaningful commit messages and manage merge conflicts if they arise.

Submission:
- URL to the GitHub repository containing all code, Dockerfiles, and Kubernetes configurations.
- Screenshots or a short video demonstrating the working application.
- A brief report detailing challenges faced, especially related to version control and code management.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Functionality of the application.
- Code quality and organization.
- Proper use of Docker and Kubernetes.
- Effective use of GitHub for version control including branches, commits, and pull requests.
- Documentation quality in README.md and in-line comments.
